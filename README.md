## Overview
This project is an interactive webpage that showcases a historical grocery list created by the Renaissance artist Michelangelo Buonarroti. The list, featuring hand-drawn illustrations of food items, provides a glimpse into the daily life of one of history's greatest artists. Users can explore the list by interacting with hotspots on the document, revealing details about each item, and toggle between original and translated views. The webpage is designed to be responsive, accessible, and engaging on both desktop and mobile browsers.

The document is based on an artifact from [Casa Buonarroti](https://www.casabuonarroti.it), Michelangelo's family home turned museum in Florence, Italy.

## Features
- **Interactive Hotspots**: Click or tap on hotspots over the grocery list to learn about items like bread, wine, and fish.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices with smooth touch interactions.
- **Translation Toggle**: Switch between the original view and a translated view with highlighted hotspots.
- **Accessibility**: Includes keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and ARIA attributes for better usability.
- **Educational Content**: An info panel provides historical context about Michelangelo and the Renaissance diet.
- **Subtle Animations**: Hotspots and tooltips feature animations for a more engaging user experience.
